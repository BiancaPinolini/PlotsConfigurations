doTop.sh
==============

Compute Top SFs and perform the Likelihood scan:
  
    bash doTop.sh datacard.txt outputFileSF.txt outputFileLH.txt
  
NB: to be used on top of the combined datacard after the unblinding!



Compute DYtt SFs and perform the Likelihood scan:
  
    bash dodytt.sh outputFileSF.txt outputFileLH.txt

NB: the script wants the datacard folder with the two separated datacards for dy0jet and dy1jet with a fixed structure. This has to be fixed.
